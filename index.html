I have needed help on my Astoria RV on a couple occasions now and have been so glad I ran across Affordable Service and Brian!! Brian has always been quick to respond to my questions and concerns and if he can’t help me with a quick fix over the phone, then he gets me into his schedule as quickly as possible! Usually within the same day or the next, depending on how severe the issue I’m having, he comes to my location and solves my problems quickly as possible! He’s always in a great mood, pleasant to talk to about my problems and can diagnose my issues quickly, and I always have those weird “never seen that happen before problems, and gets us up and going! He’s always honest with me about what my problem is and doesn’t try to upsell me on anything or make it sound worse than it is and these days that’s such a breath of fresh air to be able to trust someone doing repairs for you! I highly recommend Brian and Affordable Services and wouldn’t hesitate to use them at all! He is my first call when I have any concerns I can’t figure out on my own!!"
